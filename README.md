  Advent of Code - 2022
  </h1>

This repository contains my solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code written in python. Each folder contains the script for each day.

The questions can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), alongside input datasets that are different for each user.

The uploaded scripts may be "complete" but they are regularly updated to improve efficiency and readibility. 

This project is ongoing and I am currently on day 11/25
